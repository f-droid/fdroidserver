F-Droid is an installable catalogue of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software)
applications for the Android platform. The client makes it easy to browse,
install, and keep track of updates on your device.

The F-Droid server tools provide various scripts and tools that are used to
maintain the main F-Droid application repository. You can use these same tools
to create your own additional or alternative repository for publishing, or to
assist in creating, testing and submitting metadata to the main repository.

For documentation, please see the docs directory.
