# Preambel / Meta

This is an issue intended for https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver.
Gitlab requries phone and credit card information when one simply wants to bring ideas to open source projects.

I suggest moving to some truly open platform such as https://codeberg.org/.

# Issue

Updates for apps von F-Droid are provided in build cycles.
Some applications such as browser are especially sensitive to security vulnerabilities and require immediate patches.

Idea: Critical applications (I mostly think of browsers) use a separate build cycle / pipeline such that updates can be provided much faster.
