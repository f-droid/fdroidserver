Summary:Share your location
Description:
A simple way of sharing your location via a widget. You can send a message
containing a link to a map of your current location via any standard
registered sharing application - for example, an SMS message.

The recipient is sent a link to a web service. (The source for the web
service is in the same repository as the client).
.

Repo Type:git-svn
#Note - deliberately pulling from trunk, not trunk/ShareMyPosition-android,
#even though that would be more efficient, in order to preserve the
#corresponding source for the web service in our source tarball.
